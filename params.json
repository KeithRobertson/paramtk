The underlying object is automatically updated without the need for additional code. \r\n\r\nApart from creating a property sheet for a single object, ParamTk can also be used to display individual parameters from multiple objects in specific positions, allowing for the creation of flexible GUIs. \r\n\r\nNote: While ParamTk is being used successfully, it was originally written as proof of concept and thus could be simplified considerably. Additionally, creating new interfaces to Param in alternative GUI toolkits should be straightforward. If you are interested, please contact us.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nParamTk depends on Tkinter (usually included as standard with Python), PIL with its Tk interface (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/), and Param (http://ioam.github.com/param/).\r\n\r\nOfficial releases of ParamTk are available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/paramtk, and can be installed along with dependencies via `pip install paramtk` or ``easy_install paramtk``.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, after seperately installing the dependencies, ParamTk can be installed via ``python setup.py install``.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nQuestions and comments are welcome at https://github.com/ioam/paramtk/issues.","google":"","tagline":"Tk interface for Param"}
